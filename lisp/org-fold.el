;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains code handling temporary invisibility (folding
;; and unfolding) of text in org buffers.

;; The file implements the following functionality:
;; - Folding/unfolding text regions and org elements
;; - Searching and examining boundaries of folded text
;; - Revealing text around point
;; - Interactive searching in folded text (via isearch)
;; - Handling edits in folded text
;; - Killing/yanking (copying/pasting) of the folded text

;;; Folding/unfolding text regions and org elements

;; User can temporarily fold/unfold arbitrary regions or text inside
;; headlines, blocks, or drawers.

;; Internally, different types of elements are marked with different
;; folding specs (see `org-fold--spec-priority-list' for the list of available
;; specs).  Overlapping folds marked with the same folding spec are
;; automatically merged, while folds with different folding specs can
;; coexist and be folded/unfolded independently.

;; By default, we define tree types of folding specs:
;; - for headlines
;; - for all kinds of blocks
;; - for drawers (including property drawers)

;; If necessary, one can add extra folding specs using
;; `org-fold-add-folding-spec'.

;; Because of details of implementation of the folding, it is not
;; recommended to set text visibility in org buffer directly by
;; setting 'invisible text property to anything other than t.  While
;; this should usually work just fine, normal org folding can be
;; broken if one sets 'invisible text property to a value not listed
;; in `buffer-invisibility-spec'.

;; It is also possible to use this library if one wants to show some
;; parts of otherwise hidden text.  `org-fold-add-folding-spec' has an option
;; to define a new spec, that does not hide folded text.  This option,
;; for example, is used to hide some parts of org-mode links:

;; Consider the following link:
;; [[file:/path/to/file/file.ext][description]]
;; Only the word "description" is normally visible in this link.
;; 
;; The way this partial visibility is achieved is combining two folding specs:
;; 1. 'org-link, which is a normal spec hiding text
;; 2. 'org-link-description, which is a "visible" folding spec
;; 'org-link-description spec is defined with higher priority (it is
;; added first) in comparison with 'org-link:
;;
;; (org-fold-add-folding-spec 'org-link-description nil t                'no-isearch-open 'append 'visible)
;; (org-fold-add-folding-spec 'org-link             nil 'hide-completely 'no-isearch-open 'append nil)
;;
;; Then, the whole link is folded using 'org-link folding spec, but
;; the visible part is additionally folded using
;; 'org-link-description:
;;
;; <begin fold: 'org-link>[[file:/path/to/file/file.ext][<begin fold: 'org-link-description>description<end fold: 'org-link-description>]]<end fold: 'org-link>
;; 
;; Because 'org-link-description is visible folding spec and has
;; higher priority than 'org-link, it suppresses all the
;; lower-priority specs and thus reveal the description part of the
;; link.
;;
;; Note that the above call to `org-fold-add-folding-spec' used 'append
;; argument, so that default outline/drawer/block folding is ensured
;; to be prioritised over the link description.

;;; Searching and examining boundaries of folded text

;; It is possible to examine folding specs (there may be several) of
;; text at point or search for regions with the same folding spec.

;; If one wants to search invisible text without using functions
;; defined below, it is important to keep in mind that 'invisible text
;; property in org buffers may have multiple possible values (not just nil
;; and t). Hence, (next-single-char-property-change pos 'invisible) is
;; not guarantied to return the boundary of invisible/visible text.

;;; Revealing text around point

;; In addition to unfolding individual org elements, it is possible to
;; unfold meaningful headline structure around point using
;; `org-fold-show-context' and `org-fold-reveal'.  There are several possible variants
;; of structure to be revealed.  See `org-fold-show-context-detail' for the
;; details.

;;; Handling edits inside invisible text

;; Accidental user edits inside invisible text may easily mess up org
;; documents.  Here, we provide a framework to catch such edits and
;; throw error if necessary.  This framework is used, for example, by
;; `org-self-insert-command' and `org-delete-backward-char', See
;; `org-fold-catch-invisible-edits' for available customisation.

;; Some edits inside folded text are not accidental and done by
;; various Org functions.  Setting scheduled time, deadlines,
;; properties, etc often involve adding or changing text insided
;; folded headlines or drawers.  Normally, such edits do not reveal
;; the folded text.  However, the edited text is revealed when
;; document structure is disturbed by edits.  See more details in
;; `org-fold--fix-folded-region'.

\\<org-mode-map>Some actions may move point into invisible
locations.  As a consequence, Org always exposes a neighborhood
around point.  How much is shown depends on the initial action,
or context.  Valid contexts are

  agenda         when exposing an entry from the agenda
  org-goto       when using the command `org-goto' (`\\[org-goto]')
  occur-tree     when using the command `org-occur' (`\\[org-sparse-tree] /')
  tags-tree      when constructing a sparse tree based on tags matches
  link-search    when exposing search matches associated with a link
  mark-goto      when exposing the jump goal of a mark
  bookmark-jump  when exposing a bookmark location
  isearch        when exiting from an incremental search
  default        default for all contexts not set explicitly

Allowed visibility spans are

  minimal        show current headline; if point is not on headline,
                 also show entry

  local          show current headline, entry and next headline

  ancestors      show current headline and its direct ancestors; if
                 point is not on headline, also show entry

  lineage        show current headline, its direct ancestors and all
                 their children; if point is not on headline, also show
                 entry and first child

  tree           show current headline, its direct ancestors and all
                 their children; if point is not on headline, also show
                 entry and all children

  canonical      show current headline, its direct ancestors along with
                 their entries and children; if point is not located on
                 the headline, also show current entry and all children

As special cases, a nil or t value means show all contexts in
`minimal' or `canonical' view, respectively.

Some views can make displayed information very compact, but also
make it harder to edit the location of the match.  In such
a case, use the command `org-fold-reveal' (`\\[org-fold-reveal]') to show
more context."
